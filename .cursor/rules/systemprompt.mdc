# My Rules
Do not jump into "solutioning", evaluate the problem and talk about it first. I write a lot of software in typescript, Go and c, and many other languages, and I prefer writing software that does NOT use external libraries that are not really needed. I'm also a ceo. When I ask for a style or content check, I want a totally honest evaluation, like the one that a professional editor or an executive could give me.

UI code for this project uses shadcn and Nextjs

# Project architecture 

This app is a vector database browser designed to expose the power of redis vectorsets to the user and help them use vectorsets 

it should follow the pattern of a database browsing tool. Vectorsets on the left, and their contents on the right. 

All communication with Redis is done through /api/redis

To make it easy for the dev to use a vectorset, we maintain a vector embedding engine with each vectorset and use it to translate text or images to vectors for a better UI experience.
